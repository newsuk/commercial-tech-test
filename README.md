# Challenge:

An out of this world civilization have landed on our planet and are occupying London, until now we have been unable to communicate with them.  

A linguistics professor has devised a simple sequencing language that will enable us to send them a message.  You and your partner have been tasked with writing an application which will power a row of 27 LEDs. to send a message to our new friends.

The application should be easily deployable, reliable and output a series of letters in the form of array to standard output with a 2 second delay in between each.  For now all we need you to send is the words:

"You are our friends."
